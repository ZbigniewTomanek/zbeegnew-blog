## About me


<br>

Currently I'm a member of the CTO Office team at [Datawalk](https://datawalk.com), where we focus on enhancing our company's technological competencies through innovative graph analytics and big data analysis techniques.

My passion lies in managing large data flows, machine learning, and graph networks. I strongly believe in the transformative potential of data and technology when used effectively and for the right purpose. 


My primary technologies include:

- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Go**
- **Docker**
- **Databases**

Off the screen, I have a passion for bouldering, literature, nature, and saunas. I'm a knowledge enthusiast who enjoys collecting intriguing facts.
