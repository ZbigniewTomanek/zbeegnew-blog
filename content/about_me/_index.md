Hello, there!

Currently I'm a member of the CTO Office team at [**Datawalk**](https://datawalk.com). 

My expertise lies in managing big data flows, machine learning, and graphs. 
I believe in the power of data and the transformative impacts it can have when leveraged properly. These fields allow me to dive deep into the heart of data and draw out insights that can be game-changers in their respective areas.

## My Skill Set

My primary technologies include:

- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Go**
- **Lua**
- **Docker**
- **Databases**

I thrive in environments where learning and growth are encouraged. Being a fast learner, I'm not afraid to delve into new challenges, learn new technologies, and step out of my comfort zone.

As an engineer, I always take a holistic view of a problem. I understand that every piece is a part of a larger puzzle and it's important to see how they fit together. It's this kind of thinking that allows me to anticipate challenges and create effective solutions.

Stay tuned to this blog as I share my insights, experiences, and journeys in the realm of big data and beyond.
